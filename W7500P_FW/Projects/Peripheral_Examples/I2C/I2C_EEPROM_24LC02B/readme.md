### Example Description

This example provides a basic example of how to use the I2C firmware library and
an associate I2C EEPROM driver to communicate with an I2C EEPROM device (here the
example is interfacing with M24CXX EEPROMs where XX={01, 02, 04, 08, 16, 32, 64}.

I2C peripheral is configured in Master transmitter during write operation and in
Master receiver during read operation from I2C EEPROM. 

For M24C02 to M24C15 devices, one I2C EEPROM Block address where the program
will write the buffer have to be selected from the four address available,
The EEPROM addresses where the progran start the write and the read operations
is defined in the main.c file
